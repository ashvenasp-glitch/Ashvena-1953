| Direction | Look |
|---|---|
| **A · Heritage Ivory** | Cream carton, botanical illustration, gold-ringed round window showing seasoned cashews, coloured side panel. Includes full **back panels** (about, ingredients, nutrition, storage, serving ideas, barcode/QR, FSSAI). |
| **B · Noir Royale** | Black and gold premium carton, oval beaded gold frame, gold-outlined botanicals, engraved vine on the side. |
| **C · Spice Coast** | Bright illustrated scene: a bowl heaped with cashews, flowing botanicals, a wooden scoop, and a colour-block side panel. |

## Files (per direction folder)
- `*_front-side.svg` is the **editable master for Adobe Illustrator** (File → Open). The artboard is 165 × 170 mm: a 45 mm side panel plus a 120 mm front panel. Named groups (`Front_Panel`, `Illustration`, `Product_Name`, `Footer`, `Side_Panel`, …) appear as layers. Text is live.
- `*_back.svg` (Direction A only) is the back panel, 120 × 170 mm.
- `*.pdf` is a vector PDF at the same size, and `*.png` is a preview.

**Fonts** (free, Google Fonts): Cinzel, Cormorant Garamond, Montserrat. Install them before opening in Illustrator.

## Before print, replace these placeholders
- Nutrition values (indicative only), ingredient percentages, and claims ("Made in India"). Get them from your lab report and your recipe.
- FSSAI licence no., address, MRP, barcode (EAN), QR code, batch and dates.
- Add bleed (3 mm), glue flap, top and bottom tuck flaps for your printer's actual dieline.
